# Multimode-fiber-Image-reconstruction
This repository stores my codes to improve the image reconstruction process for multimode fiber experiments. 

Multimode fibers(MMF) scramble the waves propagating inside them and produce seemingly random patterns known as speckles at their outputs. Despite this seemingly random nature, the system consisting of an input pattern, propagating through an MMF and a detector, behaves deterministically. It has been shown by many studies that image transmission or imaging through an MMF could be carried out. For example, by analog phase conjugation, digital iterative methods, digital phase conjugation or measuring experimentally the amplitude and phase of the output patterns corresponding to each other.

What we are tring to do is to reconstruct MMF images using machine learning methods.

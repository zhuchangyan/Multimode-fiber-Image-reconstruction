 Q: Why there are 12000 SLM images but only 80000 speckle images? (Thanks Jawaria Maqbool for the question)
 
 A: The first 80000 SLM images are related to first 80000 labels and speckle images. 
 We have 120,000 SLM images simply because we took all the images from MNIST and fashion MNIST dataset, but in experiment we didn't use all of them.
